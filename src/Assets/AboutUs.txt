Jay - Owner/Artist

I first started drawing about 15years ago when my children first asked me draw a picture of 'The Lion King' for them. I've never considered myself as an artist before but do have a great eye for detail. So, I gave it a go and was astounded by how good it was.... even if I do say so myself! As you can imagine, the kids soon asked me to draw anything and everything. Then came the question... "Can you draw a picture on my bedroom wall?". The passion was ignited....

From that first painting came lots of requests from family and friends.

Whilst painting, I still worked full-time and fitted my pastime around my work and family commitments. This carried on for a couple of years until other people were offering to pay me a proper wage to decorate their rooms. At this point came the big decision... which career path do I choose? My wife became pregnant with our fourth child (yes, fourth! We actually have five now!) and the I got offered a significant promotion. I took the safe option and had a successful career as an Operations Manager in a Construction company for over 10 years but I still kept my hand-in with the painting.

As the recession hit, the company folded and I was made redundant. After spending time at home being a 'house-husband' its time for a new challenge...

Also, all our artists are DBS checked.
